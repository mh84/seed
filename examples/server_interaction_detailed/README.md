## Server interaction detailed example (WIP)

A more complicated example of retrieving and using data from a server, and outputing
 multiple wasm files. It's intended
to imitate a realistic use. You may compile and run this example, but it will 
not work as intended, since the server is not-yet included. You may still find 
examining the files useful.

---
Navigate to one of the subdirectories (eg, `reports`), and run.

```bash
cargo make all
```
